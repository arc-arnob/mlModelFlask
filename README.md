# Instructions
1. Live version of the project has been deployed on heroku. You can visit https://mlhub.herokuapp.com/ to view the project.
2. For testing our site, you can download the data set from the website menu bar. You can use the images there to run your tests.
3. To set up the project on your local computer, you need to install all the packages in the requirements.txt file using pip install -r requirements.txt
4. The models were trained on a 64 bit architecture, so make sure your python version is made for 64 bit systems.
5. Once everything is setup, you can run the server by using the command 'flask run'. The application, by default, runs on localhost on port 5000.
